			<p class="bat_first">This time of year, the thought of it is enough to make one hanker for it: “bodacious,” fresh corn on the cob. Picture it steaming on a platter, dressed simply with butter, salt and pepper (or whatever your favorite fixings), ready to savor.</p>
			<p>Where to get some?!</p>
			<p>Many country farms north of Eugene-Springfield are presently up to their ears in corn, picked daily from wide swaths of golden cornfields.</p>
			<p>The farms are ripe with other bounty, too: peaches, peppers, tomatoes, apples, beets, greens, gourds for fall décor, U-pick flowers. The list is long and enticing.</p>
			<p>But farms are not all that’s out in the country.</p>
			<p>From River Road to Harrisburg and back to Eugene via Coburg Road, there are many stops — parks, eateries, antique shops — around which to plan fun-filled weekend hours, whether with the kids, friends or that special someone.</p>
			<p>Even if fresh corn isn’t enough to entice you, delicious surprises await along this 35-mile loop that promises to be so picturesque you’ll vow to return again.</p>
			<p>So, pack the reusable bags and/or a cooler. Bring your appetites and a willingness to explore. Once you’ve left the city limits, drink in the scenery at its peak harvest time heading into autumn’s full glory.</p>
			<h2>Suggested itineraries</h2>
			<p>There are so many stops to choose from along this 35-mile country drive loop from River Road to Harrisburg and back to Eugene via Coburg Road. To make it a little easier, here are three suggested itineraries designed to suit your group:</p>
			<h4> JUST RIGHT FOR KIDS</h4>
			<p>Parents needn’t worry that there isn’t enough to keep the kids happy and well fed throughout this country outing.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Start off with feeding the goats, enjoying the playground and even mining for treasures at Lone Pine Farms; maybe even snack on some ice cream or kettle corn.</li>
				<li>Watch old-fashioned food processing equipment at work husking and cutting corn at Hentze Family Farm, which also has a kid-friendly barnyard with animals.</li>
				<li>Check out the “Pup’s Menu” at Junkyard Extreme Burgers and Brats, with hot dogs and grilled cheese.</li>
				<li>Pick some fresh produce with the kids at Detering Orchards, or let them play some corn hole in the shade if it’s too hot. Detering’s “Corn & Dog Daze” are Sept. 12-14.</li>
				<li>And if they’re not worn out yet, they can let off that last steam at Norma Pfeiffer Park in Coburg (while you go antiquing for a bit). Finish off with a slice of pizza at Coburg Pizza Company.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>FLOWER POWER FOR FRIENDS</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Visit the charming farmstand at Groundwork Organics for some fresh flowers, before turning into Thistledown Farm for a look at the wide variety of rustic garden art, including metal flower sculptures.</li>
				<li>Cut some fresh flowers at Lone Pine Farms.</li>
				<li>Enjoy the floral display outside Junkyard Extreme Burgers and Brats, where discarded tires serve as charming planters, before getting a tasty Pesto Brat.</li>
				<li>Pick up a fresh fruit pie at Wild Plum Pies before heading to Agrarian Ales to sip on a summer white ale called Jiggy Wit It. Warning: You might stay here awhile.</li>
				<li>Pop into Johnson Brothers Greenhouses where ideas abound for your gardens, even as the growing season wanes.</li>
				<li>Visit Retro Rejuvenation in Coburg to find the perfect midcentury vintage ensemble that screams flower power, or hit nearby Primrose LaneAntiques for that perfect flowery piece of costume jewelry.</li>
				<li>Head home for some of that pie and coffee.</li>
			</ol>
			<h4>IT’S A DATE</h4>
			<p>So you want to make dinner together? You can get all you need and then some on this drive.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Pop into Groundwork Organics for fresh fruit, veggies, herbs and into Thistledown Farm for dried goods and pie.</li>
				<li>Cut flowers for the dinner table centerpiece at Lone Pine Farms.</li>
				<li>Visit Hentze Family Farms for a gorgeous selection of goose quills, which you also can use to decorate the dinner table (or pen some love notes).</li>
				<li>In Harrisburg, pick up some fresh steaks or chicken from Farmers’ Helper. (Don’t forget some jerky for snacking in the car.)</li>
				<li>Fill up growlers of your favorite beers on tap at Agrarian Ales.</li>
				<li>All that’s left to do is to cook and enjoy!</li>
			</ol>
